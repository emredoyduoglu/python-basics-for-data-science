This module begins a journey into Python data structures by explaining the use of lists and tuples and how they are able to store collections of data in a single variable.

Next, learn about dictionaries and how they function by storing data in pairs of keys and values, and end with Python sets to learn how this type of collection can appear in any order and will only contain unique elements.
Learning Objectives
In this lesson you will:
  Understand tuples and lists by describing and manipulating tuple combinations and list data structures.
  Demonstrate understanding of dictionaries by writing structures with correct keys and values.
  Understand the differences between sets, tuples, and lists by creating sets.
