This module discusses Python fundamentals and begins with the concepts of conditions and branching. Continue through the module and learn how to implement loops to iterate over sequences, create functions to perform a specific task, perform exception handling to catch errors, and how classes are needed to create objects.
Learning Objectives
In this lesson you will learn about:
  
  Classify conditions and branching by identifying structured scenarios with outputs.
  
  Understand loops by using visual examples and comparing them to tuples and lists.
  
  Understand functions by building a function using inputs and outputs.
  
  Explain objects and classes by identifying data types and creating a class.
